.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Dv OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER
is a numeric release version identifier.
The first two digits contain the major release number,
the third and fourth digits the minor release number,
the fifth and sixth digits the fix release number,
the seventh and eight digits the patch release number.
The final digit is 0 for development, 1 to e for betas 1 to 14, or f
for release.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
0x000906000 == 0.9.6 dev
0x000906023 == 0.9.6b beta 3
0x00090605f == 0.9.6e release
.Ed
.Pp
Versions prior to 0.9.3 had identifiers < 0x0930.
For versions between 0.9.3 and 0.9.5,
the seventh digit was 1 for release and 0 otherwise,
and the eighth and ninth digits were the patch release number.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal
0x000904100 == 0.9.4 release
0x000905000 == 0.9.5 dev
.Ed
.Pp
Version 0.9.5a had an interim interpretation that is like the current
one, except the patch level got the highest bit set, to keep continuity.
The number was therefore 0x0090581f.
.Pp
For backward compatibility, SSLEAY_VERSION_NUMBER is also defined.
.Pp
.Fn SSLeay
returns this number.
The return value can be compared to the macro to make sure that the
correct version of the library has been loaded, especially when using
DLLs on Windows systems.
.Pp
.Fn SSLeay_version
returns different strings depending on
.Fa t :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dv SSLEAY_VERSION
The text variant of the version number and the release date.
For example, "OpenSSL 0.9.5a 1 Apr 2000".
.It Dv SSLEAY_CFLAGS
The compiler flags set for the compilation process in the form
"compiler: ..." if available or "compiler: information not available"
otherwise.
.It Dv SSLEAY_BUILT_ON
The date of the build process in the form "built on: ..." if available
or "built on: date not available" otherwise.
.It Dv SSLEAY_PLATFORM
The "Configure" target of the library build in the form "platform: ..."
if available or "platform: information not available" otherwise.
.It Dv SSLEAY_DIR
The "OPENSSLDIR" setting of the library build in the form "OPENSSLDIR:
"..."" if available or "OPENSSLDIR: N/A" otherwise.
.El
.Pp
For an unknown
.Fa t ,
the text "not available" is returned.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
