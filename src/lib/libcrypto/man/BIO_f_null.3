.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn BIO_f_null
returns the null filter BIO method.
This is a filter BIO that does nothing.
As may be apparent, a null filter BIO is not particularly useful.
.Pp
All requests to a null filter BIO are passed through to the next BIO
in the chain: this means that a BIO chain containing a null filter BIO
behaves just as though the BIO was not there.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn BIO_f_null
returns the null filter BIO method.
