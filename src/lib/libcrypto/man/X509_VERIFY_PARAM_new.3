.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_VERIFY_PARAM_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt X509_VERIFY_PARAM
object.
.Pp
.Fn X509_VERIFY_PARAM_free
clears all data contained in
.Fa param
and releases all memory used by it.
If
.Fa param
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Pp
.Fn X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_table
adds
.Fa param
to a static list of
.Vt X509_VERIFY_PARAM
objects maintained by the library.
This function is extremely dangerous because contrary to the name
of the function, if the list already contains an object that happens
to have the same name, that old object is not only silently removed
from the list, but also silently freed, which may silently invalidate
various pointers existing elsewhere in the program.
.Pp
.Fn X509_VERIFY_PARAM_lookup
searches this list for an object of the given
.Fa name .
If no match is found, the predefined objects built-in to the library
are also inspected.
.Pp
.Fn X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get_count
returns the sum of the number of objects on this list and the number
of predefined objects built-in to the library.
Note that this is not necessarily the total number of
.Vt X509_VERIFY_PARAM
objects existing in the program because there may be additional such
objects that were never added to the list.
.Pp
.Fn X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get0
accesses predefined and user-defined objects using
.Fa id
as an index, useful for looping over objects without knowing their names.
An argument less than the number of predefined objects selects
one of the predefined objects; a higher argument selects an object
from the list.
.Pp
.Fn X509_VERIFY_PARAM_table_cleanup
deletes all objects from this list.
It is extremely dangerous because it also invalidates all data that
was contained in all objects that were on the list and because it
frees all these objects, which may invalidate various pointers
existing elsewhere in the program.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_VERIFY_PARAM_new
returns a pointer to the new object, or
.Dv NULL
on allocation failure.
.Pp
.Fn X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_table
returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.
.Pp
.Fn X509_VERIFY_PARAM_lookup
and
.Fn X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get0
return a pointer to an existing built-in or user-defined object, or
.Dv NULL
if no object with the given
.Fa name
is found, or if
.Fa id
is at least
.Fn X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get_count .
.Pp
.Fn X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get_count
returns a number of objects.
