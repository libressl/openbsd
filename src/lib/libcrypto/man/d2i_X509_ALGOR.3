.Nd AlgorithmIdentifier functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/x509.h
.Ft X509_ALGOR *
.Fo d2i_X509_ALGOR
.Fa "X509_ALGOR **a"

.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions decode and encode an
.Vt X509_ALGOR
structure which is equivalent to the ASN.1
.Vt AlgorithmIdentifier
structure.
They otherwise behave in a way similar to
.Xr d2i_X509 3
and
.Xr i2d_X509 3 .
