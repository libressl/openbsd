.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn DSA_generate_parameters_ex
generates primes p and q and a generator g for use in the DSA and stores
the result in
.Fa dsa .
.Pp
.Fa bits
is the length of the prime to be generated; the DSS allows a maximum of
1024 bits.
.Pp
If
.Fa seed
is
.Dv NULL
or
.Fa seed_len
< 20, the primes will be generated at random.
Otherwise, the seed is used to generate them.
If the given seed does not yield a prime q, a new random seed is chosen
and placed at
.Fa seed .
.Pp
.Fn DSA_generate_parameters_ex
places the iteration count in
.Pf * Fa counter_ret
and a counter used for finding a generator in
.Pf * Fa h_ret ,
unless these are
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
A callback function may be used to provide feedback about the progress
of the key generation.
If
.Fa cb
is not
.Dv NULL ,
it will be called as shown below.
For information on the
.Vt BN_GENCB
structure, refer to
.Xr BN_GENCB_call 3 .
.Bl -bullet
.It
When a candidate for q is generated,
.Fn BN_GENCB_call cb 0 m++
is called
.Pf ( Fa m
is 0 for the first candidate).
.It
When a candidate for q has passed a test by trial division,
.Fn BN_GENCB_call cb 1 -1
is called.
While a candidate for q is tested by Miller-Rabin primality tests,
.Fn BN_GENCB_call cb 1 i
is called in the outer loop (once for each witness that confirms that
the candidate may be prime);
.Fa i
is the loop counter (starting at 0).
.It
When a prime q has been found,
.Fn BN_GENCB_call cb 2 0
and
.Fn BN_GENCB_call cb 3 0
are called.
.It
Before a candidate for p (other than the first) is generated and tested,
.Fn BN_GENCB_call cb 0 counter
is called.
.It
When a candidate for p has passed the test by trial division,
.Fn BN_GENCB_call cb 1 -1
is called.
While it is tested by the Miller-Rabin primality test,
.Fn BN_GENCB_call cb 1 i
is called in the outer loop (once for each witness that confirms that
the candidate may be prime).
.Fa i
is the loop counter (starting at 0).
.It
When p has been found,
.Fn BN_GENCB_call cb 2 1
is called.
.It
When the generator has been found,
.Fn BN_GENCB_call cb 3 1
is called.
.El
.Pp
.Fn DSA_generate_parameters
(deprecated) works in much the same way as for
.Fn DSA_generate_parameters_ex ,
except that no
.Fa dsa
parameter is passed and instead a newly allocated
.Vt DSA
structure is returned.
Additionally "old style" callbacks are used instead of the newer
.Vt BN_GENCB
based approach.
Refer to
.Xr BN_generate_prime 3
for further information.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn DSA_generate_parameters_ex
returns a 1 on success, or 0 otherwise.
.Pp
.Fn DSA_generate_parameters
returns a pointer to the
.Vt DSA
structure, or
.Dv NULL
if the parameter generation fails.
.Pp
The error codes can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .

.Sh HISTORY
.Fn DSA_generate_parameters
appeared in SSLeay 0.8.
The
.Fa cb_arg
argument was added in SSLeay 0.9.0.
In versions up to OpenSSL 0.9.4,
.Fn callback 1 ...\&
was called in the inner loop of the Miller-Rabin test whenever it
reached the squaring step (the parameters to
.Fn callback
did not reveal how many witnesses had been tested); since OpenSSL 0.9.5,
.Fn callback 1 ...\&
is called as in
.Xr BN_is_prime 3 ,
i.e. once for each witness.
.Sh BUGS
Seed lengths > 20 are not supported.
