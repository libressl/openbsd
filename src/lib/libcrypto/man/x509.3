.Nd X.509 certificate handling
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/x509.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A X.509 certificate is a structured grouping of information about an
individual, a device, or anything one can imagine.
A X.509 CRL (certificate revocation list) is a tool to help determine if
a certificate is still valid.
The exact definition of those can be found in the X.509 document from
ITU-T, or in RFC3280 from PKIX.
In OpenSSL, the type
.Vt X509
is used to express such a certificate, and the type
.Vt X509_CRL
is used to express a CRL.
.Pp
A related structure is a certificate request, defined in PKCS#10 from
RSA Security, Inc., also reflected in RFC2896.
In OpenSSL, the type
.Vt X509_REQ
is used to express such a certificate request.
.Pp
To handle some complex parts of a certificate, there are the types
.Vt X509_NAME
to express a certificate name,
.Vt X509_ATTRIBUTE
to express a certificate attribute,
.Vt X509_EXTENSION
to express a certificate extension, and a few more.
.Pp
Finally, there's the supertype
.Vt X509_INFO ,
which can contain a CRL, a certificate, and a corresponding private key.
.Pp
The functions
.Fa X509_* ,
.Fa d2i_X509_* ,
and
.Fa i2d_X509_*
handle X.509 certificates, with some exceptions shown below.
.Pp
.Fa X509_CRL_* ,
.Fa d2i_X509_CRL_* ,
and
.Fa i2d_X509_CRL_*
handle X.509 CRLs.
.Pp
.Fa X509_REQ_* ,
.Fa d2i_X509_REQ_* ,
and
.Fa i2d_X509_REQ_*
handle PKCS#10 certificate requests.
.Pp
.Fa X509_NAME_*
handle certificate names.
.Pp
.Fa X509_ATTRIBUTE_*
handle certificate attributes.
.Pp
.Fa X509_EXTENSION_*
handle certificate extensions.
