.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_CRL_get0_by_serial
attempts to find a revoked entry in
.Fa crl
for serial number
.Fa serial .
If it is successful, it sets
.Pf * Fa ret
to the internal pointer of the matching entry.
Consequently,
.Pf * Fa ret
must not be freed up after the call.
.Pp
.Fn X509_CRL_get0_by_cert
is similar to
.Fn X509_CRL_get0_by_serial
except that it looks for a revoked entry using the serial number
of certificate
.Fa x .
.Pp
.Fn X509_CRL_get_REVOKED
returns an internal pointer to a stack of all revoked entries for
.Fa crl .
It is implemented as a macro.
.Pp
.Fn X509_REVOKED_set_serialNumber
sets the serial number of
.Fa r
to
.Fa serial .
The supplied
.Fa serial
pointer is not used internally so it should be freed up after use.
.Pp
.Fn X509_REVOKED_set_revocationDate
sets the revocation date of
.Fa r
to
.Fa tm .
The supplied
.Fa tm
pointer is not used internally so it should be freed up after use.
.Pp
.Fn X509_CRL_add0_revoked
appends revoked entry
.Fa rev
to CRL
.Fa crl .
The pointer
.Fa rev
is used internally so it must not be freed up after the call: it is
freed when the parent CRL is freed.
.Pp
.Fn X509_CRL_sort
sorts the revoked entries of
.Fa crl
into ascending serial number order.
.Pp
Applications can determine the number of revoked entries returned by
.Fn X509_CRL_get_revoked
using
.Xr sk_X509_REVOKED_num 3
and examine each one in turn using
.Xr sk_X509_REVOKED_value 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_CRL_get0_by_serial ,
.Fn X509_CRL_get0_by_cert ,
.Fn X509_REVOKED_set_serialNumber ,
.Fn X509_REVOKED_set_revocationDate ,
.Fn X509_CRL_add0_revoked ,
and
.Fn X509_CRL_sort
return 1 for success or 0 for failure.
.Pp
.Fn X509_CRL_get_REVOKED
returns a STACK of revoked entries.
