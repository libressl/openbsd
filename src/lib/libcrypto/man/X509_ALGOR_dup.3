.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_ALGOR_dup
returns a copy of
.Fa alg .
.Pp
.Fn X509_ALGOR_set0
sets the algorithm OID of
.Fa alg
to
.Fa aobj
and the associated parameter type to
.Fa ptype
with value
.Fa pval .
If
.Fa ptype
is
.Sy V_ASN1_UNDEF
the parameter is omitted, otherwise
.Fa ptype
and
.Fa pval
have the same meaning as the
.Sy type
and
.Sy value
parameters to
.Xr ASN1_TYPE_set 3 .
All the supplied parameters are used internally so must
.Sy NOT
be freed after this call.
.Pp
.Fn X509_ALGOR_get0
is the inverse of
.Fn X509_ALGOR_set0 :
it returns the algorithm OID in
.Sy *paobj
and the associated parameter in
.Sy *pptype
and
.Sy *ppval
from the
.Sy AlgorithmIdentifier
.Fa alg .
.Pp
.Fn X509_ALGOR_set_md
sets the
.Sy AlgorithmIdentifier
.Fa alg
to appropriate values for the message digest
.Fa md .
.Pp
.Fn X509_ALGOR_cmp
compares
.Fa a
and
.Fa b
and returns 0 if they have identical encodings and non-zero otherwise.
