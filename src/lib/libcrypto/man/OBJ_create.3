.Dt OBJ_CREATE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm OBJ_create ,
.Nm OBJ_cleanup
.Nd modify the table of ASN.1 object identifiers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/objects.h
.Ft int
.Fo OBJ_create
.Fa "const char *oid"
.Fa "const char *sn"
.Fa "const char *ln"
.Fc
.Ft void
.Fn OBJ_cleanup void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn OBJ_create
adds a new object to the internal table.
.Fa oid
is the numerical form of the object,
.Fa sn
the short name and
.Fa ln
the long name.
A new NID is returned for the created object.
.Pp
The new object added to the internal table and all the data
contained in it is marked as not dynamically allocated.
Consequently, retrieving it with
.Xr OBJ_nid2obj 3
or a similar function and then calling
.Xr ASN1_OBJECT_free 3
on the returned pointer will have no effect.
.Pp
.Fn OBJ_cleanup
cleans up the internal object table: this should be called before
an application exits if any new objects were added using
.Fn OBJ_create .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn OBJ_create
returns the new NID or
.Dv NID_undef
if an error occurs.
.Pp
In some cases of failure of
.Fn OBJ_create ,
the reason can be determined with
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a new NID and initialize an object from it:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
int new_nid;

ASN1_OBJECT *obj;
new_nid = OBJ_create("1.2.3.4", "NewOID", "New Object Identifier");
obj = OBJ_nid2obj(new_nid);
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ASN1_OBJECT_new 3 ,
.Xr OBJ_nid2obj 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn OBJ_cleanup
first appeared in SSLeay 0.8.0 and
.Fn OBJ_create
in SSLeay 0.9.0.
These functions have been available since
.Ox 2.4 .
