.Sh BUGS
This manual page does not explain what the extension actually does
because no authoritative information was found online so far.
.Pp
The only hint was found in an ancient white paper "Securing IBM
Applications with Public Key Infrastructure" on the IBM website,
dated June 13, 2001: "Thawte also has a technology called Strong
Extranet that allows institutions to encode customer information
in the extensions to their customer's certificates.
Because multiple institutions can add information, the user needs
only one certificate, making renewal and revocation simpler, although
the issue of modifying an extension to an existing certificate is
not addressed."
.Pp
It is unclear whether that explanation is accurate, but in any case,
it is not very specific.
