.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn CMS_ReceiptRequest_create0
creates a signed receipt request structure.
The signedContentIdentifier field is set using
.Fa id
and
.Fa idlen ,
or it is set to 32 bytes of pseudo random data if
.Fa id
is
.Dv NULL .
If
.Fa receiptList
is
.Dv NULL ,
the allOrFirstTier option in receiptsFrom
is used and set to the value of the
.Fa allorfirst
parameter.
If
.Fa receiptList
is not
.Dv NULL ,
the receiptList option in receiptsFrom is used.
The
.Fa receiptsTo
parameter specifies the receiptsTo field value.
.Pp
The
.Fn CMS_add1_ReceiptRequest
function adds a signed receipt request
.Fa rr
to the
.Vt CMS_SignerInfo
structure
.Fa si .
.Pp
.Fn CMS_get1_ReceiptRequest
looks for a signed receipt request in
.Fa si .
If any is found, it is decoded and written to
.Fa prr .
.Pp
.Fn CMS_ReceiptRequest_get0_values
retrieves the values of a receipt request.
The signedContentIdentifier is copied to
.Fa pcid .
If the allOrFirstTier option of receiptsFrom is used,
its value is copied to
.Fa pallorfirst ;
otherwise the receiptList field is copied to
.Fa plist .
The receiptsTo parameter is copied to
.Fa prto .
.Pp
For more details on the meaning of the fields see RFC2634.
.Pp
The contents of a signed receipt should only be considered meaningful if
the corresponding
.Vt CMS_ContentInfo
structure can be successfully verified using
.Xr CMS_verify 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn CMS_ReceiptRequest_create0
returns a signed receipt request structure or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurred.
.Pp
.Fn CMS_add1_ReceiptRequest
returns 1 for success or 0 if an error occurred.
.Pp
.Fn CMS_get1_ReceiptRequest
returns 1 is a signed receipt request is found and decoded.
It returns 0 if a signed receipt request is not present or -1 if it is
present but malformed.
