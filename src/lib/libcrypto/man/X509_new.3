.Sh NAME
.Nm X509_new ,
.Nm X509_free ,
.Nm X509_up_ref
.Nd X509 certificate ASN.1 allocation functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/x509.h
.Ft X509 *
.Fn X509_new void
.Ft void
.Fo X509_free
.Fa "X509 *a"
.Fc
.Ft int
.Fo X509_up_ref
.Fa "X509 *a"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The X509 ASN.1 allocation routines allocate and free an
.Vt X509
structure, which represents an X509 certificate.
.Pp
.Fn X509_new
allocates and initializes a X509 structure with reference count 1.
.Pp
.Fn X509_free
decrements the reference count of the
.Vt X509
structure
.Fa a
and frees it up if the reference count reaches 0.
If
.Fa a
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Pp
.Fn X509_up_ref
increments the reference count of
.Fa a .
This function is useful if a certificate structure is being used
by several different operations each of which will free it up after
use: this avoids the need to duplicate the entire certificate
structure.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the allocation fails,
.Fn X509_new
returns
.Dv NULL
and sets an error code that can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.
.Pp
.Fn X509_up_ref
returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr d2i_X509 3 ,
.Xr ERR_get_error 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn X509_new
and
.Fn X509_free
are available in all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.
