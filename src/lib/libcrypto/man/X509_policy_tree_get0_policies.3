.Sh NAME
.Nm X509_policy_tree_get0_policies ,
.Nm X509_policy_tree_get0_user_policies
.Nd retrieve arrays of policy tree nodes
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/x509_vfy.h
.Ft STACK_OF(X509_POLICY_NODE) *
.Fn X509_policy_tree_get0_policies "const X509_POLICY_TREE *tree"
.Ft STACK_OF(X509_POLICY_NODE) *
.Fn X509_policy_tree_get0_user_policies "const X509_POLICY_TREE *tree"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Em authority set
and the
.Em user set
are arrays of nodes from a policy
.Fa tree .
.Pp
If the last level of a
.Fa tree ,
or equivalently, all levels of it, contain an
.Sy anyPolicy
node, the authority set contains
only this anyPolicy node from the last level.
Unless the array of
.Fa policy_oids
passed to
.Xr X509_policy_check 3
contained an anyPolicy object,
the user set contains one node for each of the
.Fa policy_oids ;
specifically, the first matching node that is a child of an anyPolicy node.
.Pp
If the last level of the
.Fa tree
does not contain an
.Sy anyPolicy
node, the authority set contains
all non-anyPolicy nodes that are children of anyPolicy nodes.
For each element of the
.Fa policy_oids ,
the user set contains the first node from the authority set
matching it, if any.
.Pp
These functions are intended to be called after
.Xr X509_policy_check 3
was called either directly or indirectly through
.Xr X509_verify_cert 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_policy_tree_get0_policies
returns an internal pointer to the authority set
or
.Dv NULL
if the
.Fa tree
argument is
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
.Fn X509_policy_tree_get0_user_policies
returns an internal pointer to the user set or
.Dv NULL
if the
.Fa tree
argument is
.Dv NULL
or if the array of
.Fa policy_oids
passed to
.Xr X509_policy_check 3
was empty or contained an anyPolicy object.
