.Dt RSA_NEW 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm RSA_new ,
.Nm RSA_free
.Nd allocate and free RSA objects
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/rsa.h
.Ft RSA *
.Fn RSA_new void
.Ft void
.Fo RSA_free
.Fa "RSA *rsa"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn RSA_new
allocates and initializes an
.Vt RSA
structure.
It is equivalent to calling
.Fn RSA_new_method NULL .
.Pp
.Fn RSA_free
frees the
.Vt RSA
structure and its components.
The key is erased before the memory is returned to the system.
If
.Fa rsa
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the allocation fails,
.Fn RSA_new
returns
.Dv NULL
and sets an error code that can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 ,
.Xr rsa 3 ,
.Xr RSA_generate_key 3 ,
.Xr RSA_new_method 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn RSA_new
and
.Fn RSA_free
are available in all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.
