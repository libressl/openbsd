.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn d2i_X509_NAME
decodes
.Fa length
bytes of the DER-encoded string
.Pf * Fa in
and stores the resulting Name object in
.Pf * Fa name .
.Pp
.Fn i2d_X509_NAME
encodes
.Fa name
into DER format and stores the result to
.Pf * Fa out .
.Pp
.Fn X509_NAME_dup
copies
.Fa name
by calling
.Fn i2d_X509_NAME
and
.Fn d2i_X509_NAME .
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_NAME_ENTRY
decodes
.Fa length
bytes of the DER-encoded string
.Pf * Fa in
and stores the resulting RelativeDistinguishedName object in
.Pf * Fa ne .
.Pp
.Fn i2d_X509_NAME_ENTRY
encodes
.Fa ne
into DER format and stores the result to
.Pf * Fa out .
.Pp
.Fn X509_NAME_ENTRY_dup
copies
.Fa ne
by calling
.Fn i2d_X509_NAME_ENTRY
and
.Fn d2i_X509_NAME_ENTRY .

.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn d2i_X509_NAME
and
.Fn X509_NAME_dup
return the new
.Vt X509_NAME
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_NAME_ENTRY
and
.Fn X509_NAME_ENTRY_dup
return the new

object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_X509_NAME
and
.Fn i2d_X509_NAME_ENTRY
returns the number of bytes successfully encoded or a negative value
if an error occurs.
