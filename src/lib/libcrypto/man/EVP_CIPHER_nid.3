.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_nid
and
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_CTX_nid
return the NID of a cipher when passed an
.Vt EVP_CIPHER
or
.Vt EVP_CIPHER_CTX
structure.
The actual NID value is an internal value which may not have a
corresponding OBJECT IDENTIFIER.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_type
and
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_CTX_type
return the type of the passed cipher or context.
This "type" is the actual NID of the cipher OBJECT IDENTIFIER as such it
ignores the cipher parameters and 40-bit RC2 and 128-bit RC2 have the
same NID.
If the cipher does not have an object identifier or does not
have ASN.1 support, this function will return
.Dv NID_undef .
.Pp
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_block_size
and
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size
return the block size of a cipher when passed an
.Vt EVP_CIPHER
or
.Vt EVP_CIPHER_CTX
structure.
The constant
.Dv EVP_MAX_BLOCK_LENGTH
is also the maximum block length for all ciphers.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_mode
and
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_CTX_mode
return the block cipher mode:
.Dv EVP_CIPH_ECB_MODE ,
.Dv EVP_CIPH_CBC_MODE ,
.Dv EVP_CIPH_CFB_MODE ,
.Dv EVP_CIPH_OFB_MODE ,
.Dv EVP_CIPH_CTR_MODE ,
or
.Dv EVP_CIPH_XTS_MODE .
If the cipher is a stream cipher then
.Dv EVP_CIPH_STREAM_CIPHER
is returned.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_nid
and
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_CTX_nid
return a NID.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_type
and
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_CTX_type
return the NID of the cipher's OBJECT IDENTIFIER or
.Dv NID_undef
if it has no defined OBJECT IDENTIFIER.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_block_size
and
.Fn EVP_CIPHER_CTX_block_size
return the block size.
