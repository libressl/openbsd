RAND - pseudo-random number generator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/rand.h>

 int  RAND_bytes(unsigned char *buf, int num);
 int  RAND_pseudo_bytes(unsigned char *buf, int num);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These functions give access to the systems cryptographically secure
pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). It is used by other library functions
for example to generate random keys, and applications can use it when they
need randomness.

L<RAND_bytes(3)|RAND_bytes(3)> describes how to obtain random data from the
PRNG.

=head1 INTERNALS

The RAND_SSLeay() method implements a PRNG based on the systems'
L<arc4random_buf(3)> random number generator.
