=head1 NAME

RAND_set_rand_method, RAND_get_rand_method, RAND_SSLeay - select RAND method

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/rand.h>

 void RAND_set_rand_method(const RAND_METHOD *meth);

 const RAND_METHOD *RAND_get_rand_method(void);

 RAND_METHOD *RAND_SSLeay(void);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These functions used to allow for the random number generator functions
to be replaced by arbitrary code.

They are kept for ABI compatibility but are no longer functional, and
should not be used in new programs.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<rand(3)|rand(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

RAND_set_rand_method(), RAND_get_rand_method() and RAND_SSLeay() are
available in all versions of OpenSSL.

In the engine version of version 0.9.6, RAND_set_rand_method() was altered to
take an ENGINE pointer as its argument. As of version 0.9.7, that has been
reverted as the ENGINE API transparently overrides RAND defaults if used,
otherwise RAND API functions work as before. RAND_set_rand_engine() was also
introduced in version 0.9.7.
