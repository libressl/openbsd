.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm crypt_checkpass ,
.Nm crypt_newhash
.Nd password hashing
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn crypt_checkpass "const char *password" "const char *hash"
.Ft int
.Fn crypt_newhash "const char *password" "const char *pref" "char *hash" "size_t hashsize"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn crypt_checkpass
function is provided to simplify checking a user's password.
If both the hash and the password are the empty string, authentication
is a success.
Otherwise, the password is hashed and compared to the provided hash.
If the hash is
.Dv NULL,
authentication will always fail, but a default
amount of work is performed to simulate the hashing operation.
A successful match will return 0.
A failure will return \-1 and set
.Xr errno 2 .
.Pp
The
.Fn crypt_newhash
function is provided to simplify the creation of new password hashes.
The provided
.Fa password
is randomly salted and hashed and stored in
.Fa hash .
The
.Fa pref
argument identifies the preferred hashing algorithm and parameters.
Refer to
.Xr login.conf 5 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Rv -std crypt_checkpass crypt_newhash
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn crypt_checkpass
function sets
.Va errno
to
.Er EACCESS
when authentication fails.
.Pp
The
.Fn crypt_newhash
function sets
.Va errno
to
.Er EINVAL
or any of the errors specified for
.Xr strtonum 3
if
.Fa pref
is unsupported.
