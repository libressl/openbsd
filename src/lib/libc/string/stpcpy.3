.Nd copy strings
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In string.h
.Ft char *
.Fn stpcpy "char *dst" "const char *src"
.Ft char *
.Fn stpncpy "char *dst" "const char *src" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn stpcpy
and
.Fn stpncpy
functions copy the string
.Fa src
to
.Fa dst
(including the terminating
.Ql \e0
character).
.Pp
The
.Fn stpncpy
function copies not more than
.Fa len
characters into
.Fa dst ,
appending
.Ql \e0
characters if
.Fa src
is less than
.Fa len
characters long, and
.Em not
terminating
.Fa dst
if the length of
.Fa src
is greater than or equal to
.Fa len .
.Pp
If the
.Fa src
and
.Fa dst
strings overlap, the behavior is undefined.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn stpcpy
function returns a pointer to the terminating
.Ql \e0
character written into
.Fa dst .
.Pp
The
.Fn stpncpy
function returns a pointer to the first
.Ql \e0
character written into
.Fa dst ,
or to
.Fa &dst[len]
if the length of
.Fa src
is greater than or equal to
.Fa len .
