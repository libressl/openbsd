=head1 NAME

RAND_load_file, RAND_write_file, RAND_file_name - PRNG seed file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/rand.h>

 const char *RAND_file_name(char *buf, size_t num);

 int RAND_load_file(const char *filename, long max_bytes);

 int RAND_write_file(const char *filename);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RAND_file_name() returns a default path for the random seed file.
B<buf> points to a buffer of size B<num> in which to store the
filename. If B<num> is too small for the path name, an error occurs.

RAND_load_file() used to allow for the state of the random number generator
to be controlled by external sources.

It is kept for ABI compatibility but is no longer functional, and
should not used in new programs.

RAND_write_file() writes a number of random bytes (currently 1024) to
file B<filename>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

RAND_load_file() always returns 0.

RAND_write_file() returns the number of bytes written, and -1 if the
bytes written were generated without appropriate seed.

RAND_file_name() returns a pointer to B<buf> on success, and NULL on
error.

L<RAND_cleanup(3)|RAND_cleanup(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

RAND_load_file(), RAND_write_file() and RAND_file_name() are available in
all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.
