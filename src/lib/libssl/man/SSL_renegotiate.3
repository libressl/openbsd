.Dt SSL_RENEGOTIATE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm SSL_renegotiate
.Nd request a new session
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/ssl.h
.Ft int
.Fo SSL_renegotiate
.Fa "SSL *ssl"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn SSL_renegotiate
manually instructs
.Fa ssl
to renegotiate and generate a new session.
.Pp
This function is automatically called by
.Xr SSL_read 3
and
.Xr SSL_write 3
whenever the renegotiation byte count set by
.Xr BIO_set_ssl_renegotiate_bytes 3
or the timeout set by 
.Xr BIO_set_ssl_renegotiate_timeout 3
are exceeded.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn SSL_renegotiate
always returns 1 unless the protocol-specific flag
.Dv SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS
is set, in which case it may return 0.
The API provides no function to set that flag;
it can only be set by manipulating internal data structures.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr SSL_read 3 ,
.Xr SSL_write 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn SSL_renegotiate
is available in all versions of OpenSSL.
