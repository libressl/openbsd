.Sh NOTES
During its use, an
.Vt SSL
object passes several states.
The state is internally maintained.
Querying the state information is not very informative before or when a
connection has been established.
It however can be of significant interest during the handshake.
.Pp
When using non-blocking sockets,
the function call performing the handshake may return with
.Dv SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ
or
.Dv SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE
condition, so that
.Fn SSL_state_string[_long]
may be called.
.Pp
For both blocking or non-blocking sockets,
the details state information can be used within the
.Fn info_callback
function set with the
.Xr SSL_set_info_callback 3
call.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Detailed description of possible states to be included later.
